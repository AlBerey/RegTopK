## Modules
There are three modules, namely DistLearn.py and DistLearnLinearReg.py and SymthDataSet. The first two modules contain distributed
learning functions used for ResNet-18 and Linear Regression, respectively. The last module further generate the synthetic dataset
used in the Linear Regression Experiment presented in section "Numerical Validation" of the main paper, as well as Section 2 of 
the supplementary file.

## Implementations
There are three main implementations: Toy_Example.py, LinearRegression.py, and ResNet18-CFAR
### Toy_Example
